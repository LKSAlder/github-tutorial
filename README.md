Hello! This is the testing repo for 599 where students will submit their test branch ðŸš€

Now that you're here...
Please follow the steps below: 

1. Clone the GitHub Repo to your local computer using method of choice (GitHub Desktop, command line etc.) 
2. Create a new Branch called "LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME_branch"
3. Publish your new Branch - say "yes I want to make this a fork" since you won't have write access to the repo
4. clone this new forked repo (that now lives on your GitHub account) to your local and work from those files.
5. Set up a file organization structure for a new project - you can add new folders (make sure to have a file in each folder or else it will not show up as a change - this can be an empty text file), show it in text like in the tutorial or describe it in words.
6. Edit the README.md file and write a brief description that you could use for your 599 project - If you already have one.. Great! Make it better in some way and submit that (add a photo? Change the font? add in your contact info?)
7. Commit changes
8. Push Changes to remote origin
9. Take a screenshot of your GitHub forked repo with your README and template folders (or folder structure description)
10. You will receive a participation grade based on the existence of this branch with your README :)
