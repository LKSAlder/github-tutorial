##599 project: Lawn distribution analysis_Lucas Pan

##This project will analyze the lawn distribution of major Ontario cities. Lawn is an important component in urban ecology. It occupied a large part of the urban area and contributed to the homogeneity of the urban landscape. It will decrease the diversity of the urban ecosystem services. We will apply aerial images, LiDAR data, and models based on R to perform the analysis.
